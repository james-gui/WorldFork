"""Lineage path helpers for the recursive multiverse DAG (PRD §13.1, §9.9).

Lineage paths are ordered lists of universe IDs from the root Big Bang
universe down to (and including) the universe being described.  They are stored
denormalized on :class:`backend.app.models.branches.BranchNodeModel` to make
ancestor/descendant queries cheap (no recursive CTEs needed for the common
"render the multiverse tree" view).

These helpers are pure functions — they do not touch the DB or the engine.
